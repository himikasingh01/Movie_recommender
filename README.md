### 🧠 How It Works
Movie genres are vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)

Similarities are calculated using cosine similarity

Based on a selected movie, the app returns the top 10 most similar movies

Genre-based recommendation returns top 10 titles matching a user-entered genre keyword
